== Description ==

With this plugin you can create as many portfolios as you want. This means that you can have multiple portfolios with multiple items each. It also registers taxonomies for tags and categories for each portfolio.

This plugin doesn't change how portfolio items are displayed in your theme.  You'll need to add templates for archive-portfolio.php and single-portfolio.php if you want to customize the display of portfolio items.

== Installation ==

Just install and activate.
